# ObjectDetetction

## Project Description 
The objective of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect objects in a video stream. Initially, a pre-made package has been utilized for training purposes, but the ultimate goal is to develop a custom-trained model that can better meet the specific requirements of the project.
